deployment scripts using Ansible:

1) install ansible
2) run playbook
3) ???
4) PROFIT!!!!


1) install Ansible
- install ansible via pip (pip is Python tool)
pip install ansible

- create ansible hosts file
cat > /etc/ansible/hosts
[nd]
our-nd-server-ips
^D

2) run playbook
depends what do you need to do:

ansible-playbook linux_one.yml -vvvv
^ runs very verbose script configuring linux machine for some details
has to be run only once
this is semi-automatic, creates users and shit.
It's recommanded to disable root ssh login + change ssh port

ansible-playbook steam_two.yml -vvvv
^ install vanilla ND server
has to be run only once

ansible-playbook update.yml
^ update ND server via our plugins pack
has to be run every time you want to update the server
NOTE: this plugin is not done yet, use ./deploy.sh for now
